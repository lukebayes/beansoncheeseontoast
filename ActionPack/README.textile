h1. Action Pack -- On rails from request to response

Action Pack splits the response to a web request into a controller part (performing the logic) and a view part (rendering a template). This two-step approach is known as an action, which will normally create, read, update, or delete (CRUD for short) some sort of model part (often backed by a service) before choosing either to render a template or redirecting to another action.

The main idea here is to destroy complex state (and thus complexity) in the Rich client environment and instead treat user gestures as we treat the HTTP request/response life cycle.
